Unfortunately, as we all know, it cannot be accessed in some places. But fortunately, OpenAI has opened up its API, so I started to write a user interface for myself.</p><blockquote><p>Nothing is difficult if you put your heart into it.</p></blockquote><p>Later, several friends asked me how to use ChatGPT because they didn&#39;t have the technical skills. So I started to develop a multi-user system, which can not only be used by myself but also help my family and friends around me.</p><p>After the project was open-sourced, many people raised issues and some even submitted PRs, and the project has developed to its current state. I also learned a lot during this process, as I have always believed that helping others is also helping oneself.</p>',9);function k(w,S){const s=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return o(),r("div",null,[d,h,u,e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[e("a",p,[t("Aissts"),n(s)]),t(" - Support multiple types of robots, Pay as you go, no need for high subscription fees.
